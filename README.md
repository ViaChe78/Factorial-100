# Factorial-100
How can you compute large factorials in C++ (like 100!)? I took the number 12345!. I have a 32″ monitor, but even it didn’t fit all the numbers, I had to make screenshots and combine the resulting ones images together. The result is 12345!=45151 symbols, including all the zeros in the number series.
